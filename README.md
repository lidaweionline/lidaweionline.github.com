Hi buddy, this is my blog
_________________________

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub. And the origin model comes from the site of mojombo, I rebulid it with my own mind.    

If you like my style of black or white, please star and fork it in Github, a link [http://github.com/yooungt13/yooungt13.github.com](http://github.com/yooungt13/yooungt13.github.com).    
    
    
__Thanks a lot.__
