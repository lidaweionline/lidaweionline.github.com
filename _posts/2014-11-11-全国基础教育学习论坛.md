Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.

One of the most powerful things we can do in our lives is to use our voices. (Our voice is everything.)
We can use our voices to set healthy boundaries, to make decisions that nourish us, to get what we want. We can use our voices to protect ourselves, to pursue our passions.
We can use our voices to do good work and help others.
But first we need to know who we are. Who we really are.
For a long time I had no clue about the person I was. I was so focused on fitting in, and wanting to like the right things, do the right things and say the right things that I wasn’t sure who I was.
I wasn’t sure about everything from the superficial — such as my likes and dislikes — to the substantial — such as my beliefs.
Writing helps us figure out who we are and what we want. We are complex beings, with intricately woven layers. These 35 prompts may help you dig deeper and unravel a few of them.

### * Write about the day you were born. Write about the obvious stuff, such as where you were born, what day, what time. Then explore the tiniest details. Talk to who was there. Are their recollections similar? Any distinct differences?
### *Write what you remember as a child. Write about random memories. Make it a list. For me, it might be: I remember standing on the swings in the park across from my grandma’s building, and trying to swing higher and higher. This might’ve been one of the only times in my life I didn’t know fear. I remember my dad buying my mom and I two cans of Coke in our Manhattan hotel on our first day in America. I remember wanting another can (it tasted soo good!). But we couldn’t afford it. I remember recreating some of Picasso’s works in my fifth grade class and absolutely loving it. I remember trick-or-treating as a witch, and trying to outrun the boys chasing my friends and I with eggs. I remember wanting to be just like the popular girls and wanting to feel pretty.
### * Write about your needs and wants as a 5-year-old, 10-year-old, 15-year-old, as a woman in your 20s and for every decade since then. What’s remained the same? What’s changed?
### * Write  what you’d like others to know about you. Start with 3 things.
### * Write down your perfect day, from morning to night. Where are you? What are you doing? What’s the temperature? Is it sunny? Is the rain coming down? What scents do you smell? Flowers? Freshly cut grass? Massage oils? Candles? No detail is insignificant.
### * Write down 5 things that anger you. Then write down how you’ll channel that anger into action.
### * Write down 20 things that make you happy. It could be anything from your favorite foods to TV shows to physical activities to your favorite people.
### * Write about your favorite physical attribute. Write about your least favorite attribute. What are the commonalities? Can you find a shred of gratitude for the trait you like least?
### * Write about a time when someone’s perspective pissed you off. Why?
### * Write about a time you felt incredibly uncomfortable in your skin. Why?
### * Write about 3 things that help you feel comfortable in your skin today, or things that might help, which you’d like to try. (For instance, you might practice a body scan every day.)
### * Write about the most recent time you were hyper-focused on an activity. What about this activity was all-consuming?
### * Write about what you’d do with your days if you had more time.
### * Write about your heroes, the people who are alive, the ones who’ve passed. Write about the books that have changed your life. (And reread them.)
### * Write about your inspirations. The images that catch your eye. The words you can’t forget. The music that stirs you.
### * Write about your favorite activities and hobbies as a child. Do you want to return to them in adulthood? How can you make that happen?
### * Write about the self-doubts that keep returning.
### * Write about a dream that keeps recurring.
### * Write about what brings you comfort and calm.
### * Write about your favorite activities to do alone.
### * Write the truest sentence that you know.
### * Write about the words you’d tell your 18-year-old self.
### * Write about what you see in the mirror.
### * Write about the work you love.
### * Write about the words you need to hear.
### * Write what you’re curious about. What would you like to learn? What would you like to discover or rediscover?
### * Write about the tastes, scents and surroundings that you’re hungry for.
### * Write about your favorite season. Write the details that you love. Write about why that season captures you.
### * Write about what you’d make with your hands, if only you had the skills.
### * Write about your favorite way to celebrate.
### * Write about your favorite jokes.
### * Write about a big moment in your life.
### * Write about what you don’t know about yourself. How can you discover it?
### * Write about one story you used to tell yourself that’s different today. For instance, I had many stories around weakness. Namely, I was convinced that I was weak physically and emotionally. I also had stories around deserving. I didn’t think I deserved certain things because I wasn’t pretty enough or smart enough or thin enough. Every day I’m revising these stories. Every day I’m realizing how inaccurate they really were. Every day I’m learning that they don’t capture the complexities of my being (or yours). Remember that you’re the storyteller, the narrator. In other words, you’re in charge of the stories you create, revise and dismantle.
### * Write about what you’d like to be remembered for.

* I was inspired to write this post after reading Barbara Abercrombie’s new book Kicking In The Wall: A Year of Writing Exercises, Prompts and Quotes To Help You Break Through Your Blocks And Reach Your Writing Goals.
Write for as long as you like. But try to write for at least several minutes. Give yourself the permission and space to delve deeper, and explore the myriad layers that make up who you are.
When you’re writing give yourself as much time (or as little time) as you like. Write when you first wake up. Write as you’re getting ready for bed.

* Write as you’re sipping tea or listening to music. Write in a coffee shop. Write as you’re sitting in the park, breathing in the cool air.Write whenever, wherever, however you like.
