      description: The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend. Typical Wes Anderson cinematic style film, visually amazing, somtimes arty and esoteric. Checkout Moonrise Kingdom or The Life Aquatic or Fantastic Mr. Fox. P.S. This movie is devoted to Stefan Zweig and Walter Benjamin(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin).
