Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.

明天晚上电力系统规划考试。虽然不知道是开卷还是闭卷，作为一位大四老油条，我先开为敬。
很幸运的通过伊顿实习的面试，今天上午收到何导的通知。当时报这个有点冲动，随之而来也有很多问题。不过现在上了贼船还是想想how to keep calm and how to get to know yourself吧。因为。。最近看卢梭《论人类不平等的起源和基础》，其中引用了德尔斐神庙上的三句箴言之一，know yourself。虽然好难懂，不过还是接着翻翻吧。。
上网查know thyself出处，看见psychcentral上一篇文章。有点意思，CV如下。需要在老爸老妈引导下慢慢做完。。。
## 35 journal prompts to know yourself
-By MARGARITA TARTAKOVSKY, MS
One of the most powerful things we can do in our lives is to use our voices. (Our voice is everything.)
We can use our voices to set healthy boundaries, to make decisions that nourish us, to get what we want. We can use our voices to protect ourselves, to pursue our passions.
We can use our voices to do good work and help others.
But first we need to know who we are. Who we really are.
For a long time I had no clue about the person I was. I was so focused on fitting in, and wanting to like the right things, do the right things and say the right things that I wasn’t sure who I was.
I wasn’t sure about everything from the superficial — such as my likes and dislikes — to the substantial — such as my beliefs.
Writing helps us figure out who we are and what we want. We are complex beings, with intricately woven layers. These 35 prompts may help you dig deeper and unravel a few of them.

### * Write about the day you were born. Write about the obvious stuff, such as where you were born, what day, what time. Then explore the tiniest details. Talk to who was there. Are their recollections similar? Any distinct differences?
### *Write what you remember as a child. Write about random memories. Make it a list. For me, it might be: I remember standing on the swings in the park across from my grandma’s building, and trying to swing higher and higher. This might’ve been one of the only times in my life I didn’t know fear. I remember my dad buying my mom and I two cans of Coke in our Manhattan hotel on our first day in America. I remember wanting another can (it tasted soo good!). But we couldn’t afford it. I remember recreating some of Picasso’s works in my fifth grade class and absolutely loving it. I remember trick-or-treating as a witch, and trying to outrun the boys chasing my friends and I with eggs. I remember wanting to be just like the popular girls and wanting to feel pretty.

### * Write about one story you used to tell yourself that’s different today. For instance, I had many stories around weakness. Namely, I was convinced that I was weak physically and emotionally. I also had stories around deserving. I didn’t think I deserved certain things because I wasn’t pretty enough or smart enough or thin enough. Every day I’m revising these stories. Every day I’m realizing how inaccurate they really were. Every day I’m learning that they don’t capture the complexities of my being (or yours). Remember that you’re the storyteller, the narrator. In other words, you’re in charge of the stories you create, revise and dismantle.
### * Write about what you’d like to be remembered for.
---------------------

* I was inspired to write this post after reading Barbara Abercrombie’s new book Kicking In The Wall: A Year of Writing Exercises, Prompts and Quotes To Help You Break Through Your Blocks And Reach Your Writing Goals.
Write for as long as you like. But try to write for at least several minutes. Give yourself the permission and space to delve deeper, and explore the myriad layers that make up who you are.
When you’re writing give yourself as much time (or as little time) as you like. Write when you first wake up. Write as you’re getting ready for bed.

* Write as you’re sipping tea or listening to music. Write in a coffee shop. Write as you’re sitting in the park, breathing in the cool air.Write whenever, wherever, however you like.
